# Preprocess Data Before Apply Flux Rope Detection Algorithm
## 1. DESCRIPTION
This folder contains all needed code to preprocess raw data. The raw data is firstly downloaded from CDAweb (https://cdaweb.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html/) via the API provided by the website. The original data format is CDF. Then raw data will be cleared, refined, and resampled. In this procedure, a combination of multiple data processing technique will be applied, including digital filter, smoothing, statistical methode and so on. Then these data will be combined in to data sets in years. The final data format is pickle format which is consist of pandas.DataFrame datatype.
