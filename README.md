# Magnetic Flux Rope Detection
## 1. DESCRIPTION
This is an automated magnetic flux rope detection package. This project is part of my PhD research. The main purpose of this project is to automatically detect the small-scale magnetic flux ropes from in-situ spacecraft obervational data.
## 2. SPACE PHYSICS BACKGROUND
To get farmiliar with the physics of magnetic flux ropes, please refer to my PhD dissertation: [OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS OF TRANSIENT AND COHERENT STRUCTURES IN SPACE PLASMAS](phd_dissertation/). It will be discoverable soon on ProQuest dissertation database. I have one journal paper and two conference proceedings which talk about the statistical analysis and case studies on small-scale magnetic flux ropes. These papers are in the same folder of my dissertation.
## 3. FLOWCHART
Following is the flowchart of core detection algorithm. Please refer to chapter 2 and chapter 3 of my dissertation for detail.
