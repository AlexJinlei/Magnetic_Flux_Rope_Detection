# Magnetic Flux Rope Detection
## DESCRIPTION
This is an automated magnetic flux rope detection package. This project is part of my PhD research. The main purpose of this project is to automatically detect the small-scale magnetic flux ropes from in-situ spacecraft obervational data.
## SPACE PHYSICS BACKGROUND
To get farmiliar with the physics of magnetic flux ropes, please refer to my PhD dissertation: OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS OF TRANSIENT AND COHERENT STRUCTURES IN SPACE PLASMAS \([ch1-3](phd_dissertation/Jinlei_PhD_Dissertation_part1_ch1-3.pdf),  [ch4-6](phd_dissertation/Jinlei_PhD_Dissertation_part2_ch4-6.pdf)\). It will be discoverable soon on ProQuest dissertation database.
