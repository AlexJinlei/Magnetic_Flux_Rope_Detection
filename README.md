# Magnetic Flux Rope Detection
## DESCRIPTION
This is an automated magnetic flux rope detection package. This project is part of my PhD research. The main purpose of this project is to automatically detect the small-scale magnetic flux ropes from in-situ spacecraft obervational data.
## SPACE PHYSICS BACKGROUND
To get farmiliar with the physics of magnetic flux ropes, please refer to my PhD dissertation: [OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS OF TRANSIENT AND COHERENT STRUCTURES IN SPACE PLASMAS](phd_dissertation/). It will be discoverable soon on ProQuest dissertation database.
